# CoursePlanner (v1)

**CoursePlanner** is a simple client-side web app intended to assist students plan their upcoming courses. Written by a backend dev and currently in v1, CoursePlanner prioritizes core functionality and features over a polished UI.

## Features

- Visualize courses on a weekday calendar.
- Toggle course visualization on/off to experiment with course combinations.
- View running total of course credit hours for currently visualized courses. (WIP)

## Upcoming work

I've only ever worked with Javascript in college (did I mention the backend dev thing?), so v1 of CoursePlanner uses vanilla JS and is not my most impressive work. Things I'd like to work on going forward include:

- Migrate to a common JS library (probably React).
- Generally improve code quality with JS best practices.
- Somehow someday find a way to create some non-contrived server-side functionality.

## Deployment

CoursePlanner is currently hosted as a static website in Google Cloud Storage and can be accessed at http://www.freecourseplanner.com.
