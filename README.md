# CoursePlanner (v2)

**CoursePlanner** is a simple client-side web app intended to assist students plan their upcoming courses. Written by a backend dev as a COVID-19 stay-at-home project, CoursePlanner prioritizes core functionality and features over a polished UI. Rewritten in React for v2, the business logic is cleaner, more functional, and more extensible than before. However, I have yet to find the motivation to dive down the CSS rabbit hole, so the UI remains minimal.

## Features

- Visualize courses on a weekday calendar.
- Toggle course visualization on/off to experiment with course combinations.
- View running total of course credit hours for currently visualized courses.

## Upcoming work

With the React rewrite, I feel content with the cleanliness and functionality of the code. I don't expect to put much more work into this project as it does the things I want it to, but the areas I think could be improved include:

- Integrate a UI-focused CSS lib (Bootstrap perhaps?).
- Actually make things look nice once the CSS lib is in place.
- Somehow someday find a way to create some non-contrived server-side functionality.

## Deployment

CoursePlanner is currently hosted as a static website in Google Cloud Storage and can be accessed at http://www.freecourseplanner.com.
